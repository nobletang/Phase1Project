    "Making a debut into the movie industry can be expensive, even for a company like Microsoft. The success of the first movie will make an impression on the community and affect the success for future productions. This study aims to provide the information necessary for Microsoft to produce a movie that grabs attention and generate high gross revenue. The journal covers the correlation between budget and gross. Both the length of a movie and type of genre also have an influence to the gross revenue. The business recommendations are backed by using movie information gathered from 1986 to 2016. Suggestions will be made for how much money should be invested into production, how long the movie should be, and which genre should the movie be categorized as."
